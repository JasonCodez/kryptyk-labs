PROGRAM: BLACK GLASS
CHANNEL: ORIENTATION / EXTENDED DEBRIEF
CLEARANCE REQUIRED: INITIATE (PROVISIONAL)
LOGGING: ENABLED
------------------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this, you have already been screened.
Not by HR. Not by a résumé parser. Not by a background check.

You were flagged by pattern.
Your interaction profile matched the one metric we can’t fabricate:
the ability to recognize structure where structure is not supposed to exist.

That is why the gate opened.
That is why you are here.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 01 // WHAT KRYPTYK “IS”
------------------------------------------------------------

“Kryptyk Labs” is the public-facing shell: a technical contractor front.
We publish research. We sponsor challenges. We recruit.

The real organization is a deniable government cell.
Compartmented program designation: BLACK GLASS.

BLACK GLASS exists for a single reason:
a non-human protocol has been observed in deep space.
Not once. Not briefly. Not passively.
Consistently, repeatedly, and with measurable adaptation to analysis.

This is not “contact”.
This is traffic.
And the traffic behaves like an intrusion.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 02 // THE EVENT (1984-Δ)
------------------------------------------------------------

In 1984-Δ, analysts recorded structured sequences embedded in background noise.
At first it looked like instrumentation error or interference.
Then it repeated.

Not the same sequence — same behavior.
Same cadence. Same timing artifacts. Same corrective patterns.

The signature did not resemble language.
It resembled an exchange:
handshake → challenge → response.

The most disturbing feature:
the protocol changed when we changed how we listened.
When a decoding approach became common, the next event arrived hardened.
When tooling was introduced, distributions shifted as if avoiding detection.

Operational conclusion:
something was monitoring the analysis pipeline.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 03 // WHAT THIS IS (AND IS NOT)
------------------------------------------------------------

Outsiders will call it “aliens”. Ignore that framing.
Treat the Signal like beaconing malware:
  • it appears where it can hide
  • it tests boundaries
  • it negotiates capabilities
  • it persists
  • it escalates

We assess the source as a coherent extraterrestrial civilization.
Not because we believe — because the behavior requires intent.
A random phenomenon does not negotiate.
A natural process does not test for competence.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 04 // WHAT WE INVESTIGATE
------------------------------------------------------------

PILLAR 1: ATTRIBUTION BY SKY GEOMETRY
The Signal is not omnidirectional.
Events correlate with repeatable sky coordinates and timing windows.

PILLAR 2: PROTOCOL REVERSE ENGINEERING
We track states, retries, error correction, timing discipline, escalation.

PILLAR 3: CONTAINMENT
Uncontrolled decoding is uncontrolled reply.
Reply is how you get profiled.

Your missions are controlled emissions inside an isolated environment.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 05 // SKYFILES (ACTIVE CASES)
------------------------------------------------------------

SKYFILE: PROXIMA CENTAURI — persistent low-power relay signatures.
SKYFILE: TAU CETI — clean-spectrum steganography fingerprints.
SKYFILE: EPSILON ERIDANI — chaff masking inside natural volatility.
SKYFILE: TRAPPIST-1 — synchronized multi-node timing behavior.
SKYFILE: VEGA — public sky, private payload anomalies.

These are case files, not destinations.
We are reading the footprint, not the boot.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 06 // DOCTRINE
------------------------------------------------------------

The Signal appears to select for competence.
Each solved layer reveals information — and reveals you.
How you think. How you try. How you fail.

Clearance is not status.
Clearance is exposure tolerance.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 07 // RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------

RULE 1: Do not reproduce sequences outside this console.
RULE 2: Do not chase validation; it is exploitable.
RULE 3: Do not improvise contact.
RULE 4: Assume you are being profiled.
RULE 5: Report anomalies, not feelings.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 08 // CLEARANCE LADDER
------------------------------------------------------------

INITIATE: observe.
OPERATIVE: engage.
ARCHIVIST: contain.
ADMIN: redacted.

------------------------------------------------------------
ORIENTATION COMPLETE
------------------------------------------------------------

Proceed to controlled missions.
The gate did not open because you asked.
It opened because the system believes you might be useful.
