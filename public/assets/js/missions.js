Welcome inside the Lab, asset.

Your first live operation is not about breaking ciphers — it's about proving you can *observe*.

Somewhere inside this Orientation Dashboard, the Lab has embedded a silent heartbeat:
a repeating signal that marks every authenticated session.

Your task:

  1. Locate the element on this console that references your "last successful authentication".
  2. Identify the *exact* label the Lab uses for that event.
  3. Record that label in your field notes — you'll need it later as part of INITIATE-02.

No external tools are required. Everything you need is visible inside the Orientation Dashboard once you clear the gate.
  `,
  hint: `
Watch the Event Stream on the right side of the Orientation Dashboard.

The line you want begins with [GATE] and mentions "last successful authentication".
